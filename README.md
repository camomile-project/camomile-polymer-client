# camomile-polymer-client

## Demo

You can try it on the github pages demo at [https://rom1504.github.io/camomile-polymer-client/](https://rom1504.github.io/camomile-polymer-client/)
using `https://camomile.rom1504.fr` as the endpoint, `root` as user and `test` as password

## Specifications

![specifications](specifications.jpg)

The objective of this project is to define [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) using [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
to make it easier to create camomile clients.

An example of use of these components is in file [index.html](index.html)

## Implementation

Polymer 2.0 will be used to implement these components.

[polymer 2.0 quick start](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/quick-tour) explains that polymer components are defined as classes.
So defining the needed components for camomile will consist in defining the relevant classes.

## Installation

* npm install -g polymer-cli
